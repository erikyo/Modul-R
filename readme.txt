== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Getting started =
* Create a menu then assign it into the primary navigation
* Go to the Widget section, and under the footer widgets box add a widget.
* Create a page then go to settings > reading and select the page as static homepage

= How install node? =
Run the installer of NodeJS from the link below:
  https://nodejs.org/en/download/
After this step, you can check if NodeJS and NPM were installed with the command:
  node -v && npm -v
if npm is installed you can run:
  npm i

= How run gulp tasks? =
There is some Gulp tasks i've prepared that simplify the development of the website:
  gulp clean
Delete unnecessary development files like source maps, thumbnail os files, and ALL the content of assets/dist (you have to compile again sources after this command).
  gulp style
Runs (once) the Sass compile task on style.scss, the autoprefixer and then creates the sourcemap.
  gulp Acf
Runs (once) the Sass compile task on acf.scss then autoprefix
  gulp imageMinify
Minify images (PNG, JPEG, GIF and SVG) from assets/src/img then copy to assets/dist/img folder.
  gulp scripts
Traspile es6 to javascript (if needed) then uglify (a sort of minify), concat (merge all files into one) and creates the sourcemap.
  gulp zipRelease
Zip all theme files into /releases/$version, it can be useful if you want to ‚Äúpackage‚Äù the theme for upload purpose.
  gulp createPot
Parse all php files into theme folder and generates the pot files for WordPress translations.
  gulp watch
You have to run this command during development, and this command will be your best friend üôÇ It runs a file watcher on sass, scripts, and images folders and when triggered run the needed gulp task. It uses the latest version of gulp which allows these tasks to run in parallel, in order to have very short compilation times.
  gulp buildAll
To finalize the theme‚Ä¶ for first run clean and removes all development files. Then compile with a set of options suitable for publication (in watch task instead the compilation speed is privileged and also the css is not minified)
  gulp buildRelease
Same as buildAll task but furthermore run the zip task
